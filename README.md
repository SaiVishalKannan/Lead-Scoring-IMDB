# Lead-Scoring-Analysis-Using-SQL-For-IMDB-Movies

# Description
This project showcases how IMDB Movies, a renowned Indian film production company, used data-driven insights to plan a film for global audiences. Having traditionally catered to the Indian market, RSVP Movies sought to leverage analytics for their next major release. This project uses SQL to dive into the dataset, revealing patterns, trends, and critical insights that would guide production strategies. The analysis is structured into four key segments, each drawing significant conclusions by combining various data tables.

# Key Features
